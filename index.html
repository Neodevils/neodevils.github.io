          This year, I was like a psychologist. The private server, <b>Minesa</b> had a lot of members who psychologically had problems. Me and my friend <b>Saku</b> were the first to talk to them. We talked about how to solve their problems. And we did! 
          <br>
          <br>
          I was so happy to be able to help them. And we all got close to each other. And we all got a lot of friends. And we all got a lot of <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-circle-plus"></i> from each other.
